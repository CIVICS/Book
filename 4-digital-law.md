## Call to Action

* Joi scenario re meaning of digital transfers (eg the date when digital instrument no longer negotiable)
* Sandy scenario re adaptive algorythmic laws (eg model tumed as cases adjudicated and capable of simulations)  

## Standard Header/Metadata 

* Location: LegalCite-HumanURL-NetworkEndpoint
* Time: Datestamp-Events-Status
* Topic: Name-EncodedTitleChapter-DefinedTerms
* References: ExternallyIncorporatedLaw-IncorporatedByExteralLaw-CitesCrossrefsAnnotations

## Conformance
* Purpose (described outcomes, performance and other scenarios intended as a result of the law)
* Success (defined method, mechanism,  measurement and metrics for establishing success of the law)
* Reporting (specification (like XBRL by SEC) who must report (role) and how to report (REST/API, etc)
* Registries (CLEVER updates, logs, FEIDs, state/status changes, special alerts/notices)

## Interoperability
* Pub/Sub
* API/Integrations
* Open/Free Reference Implementations of Key Apps, Services and Platforms (eg for external legal incorporation by ref, etc)

## Comprehensible 
* Andy Perlman Plain Meaning Crowd Test
* Inquire/Explore Via Simulator or Other Model
* Key Rules Displayable via IAuth-Like Cards

## Accountable
* Simple Input/Feedback/Comment/Complaint/Ideas on Proposed and Existing Rules
* Compliance reporting directly accessible from law itself (eg to ftp.sec.gov, etc) 
* Reasons/donations/etc of individuals, committees and external entities advocating for or against the law

## Modular, Federatable and Extensible
* Modular code, functions and components
* Federatable system architecture at federal/state/local/other contexts 
* Extensible design for common base supporting local or domain based further detail and augmentation
* 
## Sample BLT Scenario Formats

* Napkins2Launch Project Slides (esp Eximchain and Hotel Blockchain) :-)
* CSAIL Big Data Privacy Form-Based Intake (esp DTU example) :-)
* UMA Legal Wiki (and check email from Even Feb 5, 2016)  :-)
